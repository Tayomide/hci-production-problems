## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=13R0u0kv+aHlllmr2fFHP6qSq2T
Your Rationale: Blue is a cool color bringing out the calming sensation of the deep sea and the endless night. When I think of gaming I am thinking of lights off full focus on the screen and ofcourse the slightest tint or ray of white that pops up distracts or straight out blinds you. Blue is cool but it doesn't demand as much attention hence leaving some spotlight for other elements to come in while lodging the whole game together.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=5250d0kouFB8LLC5RcPtLD5felz
Your Rationale: The springtime signifies growth liberation and a new beggining from an old end, a tint is definitely needed to bring out the joyfullness and complementing contrast of yellow and green.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=3220z0kmvQe1QNO5mjQf3dPxFzX
Your Rationale: the culture and history a color speaks can not be easily understood by a child still learning the names of the said colors. With the invention of colors and a kids need to express themselves in anyway possible the color pallete needed is a variety of different colors whose sole aim is to keep the childs attention for a long time while looking like a choice of crayons a child would be proud to draw with.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=b455p5a0kbG5-1QNO5mjQf3dPxFzX
Your Rationale:As sad as it is there is a reason why UX, UI and web designing exists. Sitting in front of a code editor or just discord for hours with the prevalent dark background in the industry a cybersecuirity or programmer's sense of color is extremely skewed and we tend to relate, find solace and warmth in a really dark background and the occasional warm tinted colors for accenting like poiting out errors, or just a new tag.
