    <h1>History of lorem ipsum</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>
      It is widely believed that the history of Lorem Ipsum originates with
      Cicero in the 1st Century BC and his text De Finibus bonorum et malorum. This
      philosophical work, also known as On the Ends of Good and Evil, was split into
      five books. The Lorem Ipsum we know today is derived from parts of the first
      book Liber Primus and its discussion on hedonism, the words of which had been
      altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. It is not
      known exactly when the text gained its current traditional form. However
      references to the phrase "lorem ipsum" can be found in the 1914 Loeb Classical
      Library Edition of the De Finibus in sections 32 and 33.

      It was in this edition of the De Finibus that H. Rackman translated the text.
      The following excerpt is taken from section 32: "qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor
      sit amet consectetur adipisci velit, sed quia non
      numquam eius modi tempora incidunt, ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat
      voluptatem". This is recognisable, in part, as today's standard Lorem Ipsum and was
      translated into: "Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
      to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
      occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure".

      Advancing to the 1960s, Lorem Ipsum was made popular by typeface manufacturer
      Letraset, who used it in their advertising campaigns. Letraset offered pages of
      Lorem Ipsum as rub down transfer sheets, which were widely used in the
      pre-computer era for layouts. These transfer pages, known as Letraset Body Type,
      were featured in the company's advertising and their popular catalogue.
      Lorem Ipsum was reintroduced in the 1980s by the Aldus Corporation, a company
      that developed Desktop Publishing Software. Their most well known product
      PageMaker came with pre-installed graphics and word-processing templates
      containing a version of the faux latin language. Have you ever seen the
      term Lorem Ipsum on a new website? Perhaps you have even tried entering it
      on Google Translate, but no sensible results came through.Most people who
      see it the first time think they are in the wrong address onlyto refresh
      and come back to the same page. But, what is this mysterious text
      that you see on pages?

    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, loremipsum is dummy text that occupies the space where the real
      content should be. If you are designing an online business such as a blog and
      you do not have content already, you use a lorem ipsum generator to create
      placeholder or dummy text to show you how the business will look once you add
      the real content. Lorem ipsum is common with typesetting and printing
      businesses. The text did not
      start with the age of digital businesses as it has been used since 1500s or even
      earlier. The first use must have been in the creation of a specimen book. The
      creators wanted to know how the book will look with text on and that was when
      lorem ipsum started finding its place in the printing, typesetting, and digital
      world. The text has not changed much since the 1500s. It has held on to its place
      through the typewriter period and is now used on digital work. The release of
      Letraset sheets that contained lorem ipsum was the start of the popularity of
      lorem ipsum. Today, a lorem ipsum generator has made it easier to generate the
      text with much ease.
