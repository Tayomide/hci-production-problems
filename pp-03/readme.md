## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:
   Looking at the website I immediately saw a lot that was wrong with it without needing the HCI guidelines. After checking the HCI guidelines I found out it focuses more on the users experience and not redundant data hence I took some things out before applying the IOS HCI guidelines. BElow are the following data that was removed or updated:

   I removed the login section as there is already a login page dedicated for login

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
