## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:
   Looking at the website I immediately saw a lot that was wrong with it without needing the HCI guidelines. After checking the HCI guidelines I found out it focuses more on the users experience and not redundant data hence I took some things out before applying the IOS HCI guidelines. BElow are the following data that was removed or updated:

   I removed the login section as there is already a login page dedicated for login
   I removed the address section as the user has to go to the museum and not the museum coming to the user.
Asking for address felt like taking advantage of the users ignorance on the importance of the data in creating an account.
   I updated the account creation section with the least amount of data needed for a user to be uniquely identified while also able to book an appointment with the museum.
   I updated the footer by making each link both accessible and interactive.
   I kept the logo at the header as that gives information about the site and can be used as a navigational link for the home page which does not need a registered user to access.

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/tab-bars/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  From the book "Designing for Touch", I learnt that although tab bars can be on the bottom in apps as shown in the link above,
  tab bars in websites should be at the top as the bottom of the browser already has buttons that could cause uncomfortable user experience if mashed together.
  I made a header to act as the tab bar and placed it at the top. I also added a content to the header but since I was limited to login it was only a tab to the home page.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/text-views/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  Although executed perfectly I made sure to preserve the text legibility and format as it is easy to loose track of that when removing a lot of the inputs and a huge chunk of the form.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/scroll-views/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
